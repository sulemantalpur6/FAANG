# 🚀 DSA Preparation – FAANG Journey

This repository is dedicated to my **FAANG preparation**, starting with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I’ll be following along with **Kunal Kushwaha’s DSA Course on YouTube**, solving problems, and documenting my learning journey.

## 📚 Learning Path

I’ll be covering DSA concepts in a structured way:

1. **Basics of Programming & Recursion**
2. **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
3. **Mathematics for DSA**
4. **Bit Manipulation**
5. **Strings & Arrays**
6. **Linked List, Stack, Queue**
7. **Trees & Binary Trees**
8. **Graphs & Advanced Data Structures**
9. **Dynamic Programming**
10. **Problem Solving Practice (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)**
